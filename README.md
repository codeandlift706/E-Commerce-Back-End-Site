## Description
The purpose of this project is to build the back end for an e-commerce website.


## Installation
Clone the starter code here for the front end coding of the application: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella. VS Code to code the back end of the application. GibHub for version control. Install mysql (https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_install_windows.asp). Run npm install in the terminal after cloning the starter code to access these packages for the application: MySQL2 (https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) Sequelize and (https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize), to connect the Express.js API to a MySQL database. The dotenv package will also be accessible in the package.json, which allows the use of environment variables to store sensitive data, specifically the MySQL username, password, and database name. Download Insomnia to test the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE calls in the VS code: https://insomnia.rest/download.


## Usage

## Contribution
The starter code contains the initial setup of the back end: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella. The assignment also gave instructions for setting up the database models. The coding in the server.js file (imports, boilerplate middleware, port listener), the coding in the models files (set up its fields and rules), the coding in the index file (establishing the relations between models), and the coding in the routes files (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE calls) -all the additions- are credited to the curriculum taught in the UCI coding boot camp by the instructor.

## Tests
To test the functionality of the E-Commerce back end site, users can clone this repo, run npm install, and follow the video for steps on creating the schema from the MySQL shell (open the terminal and log into mysql, run ‘SOURCE.schema.sql;’ in the command line, run ‘USE ecommerce.db;’ in the command line), seeding the database from the command line (run “npm run seed”), and starting the application’s server (run “node server” in the command line).

Open insomnia and make calls with the base domain http://localhost:3001, with the parameters depending on what the call calls for in the routes>api>routes files. Use the videos for reference:
